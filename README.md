Finetuning LLM for Elementary Math
Project Overview
This project aims to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) to perform elementary mathematics tasks. The goal is to enhance the model's capability to solve basic arithmetic problems, understand elementary math concepts, and provide explanations for its solutions. The targeted audience includes educators, students, and developers interested in educational AI applications.

Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/finetune-llm-math.git
cd finetune-llm-math
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Preparation
Prepare your dataset consisting of elementary math problems and solutions. The data should be in a structured format (e.g., CSV or JSON).

Example of data format:

json
Copy code
[
    {
        "question": "What is 2 + 2?",
        "answer": "4",
        "explanation": "Adding 2 and 2 gives 4."
    },
    {
        "question": "Solve: 5 - 3",
        "answer": "2",
        "explanation": "Subtracting 3 from 5 gives 2."
    }
]
Place your dataset in the data/ directory.

Training
To fine-tune the model, use the provided training script:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --data_dir data/ --output_dir output/ --epochs 10 --batch_size 32
Adjust the hyperparameters as needed.

Evaluation
After training, evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py --model_dir output/ --data_dir data/test/
The evaluation script will output metrics such as accuracy and provide a detailed analysis of the model's performance.

Usage
Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to solve elementary math problems:
